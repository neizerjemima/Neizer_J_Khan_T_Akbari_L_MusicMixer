# Drag & Drop Music Mixer - The Singing Tree

The Singing Tree is a musical drag and drop mixer, a game which makes use of html, css and javascript to create responsive icon upon moving (dragging) them from a drag panel to placing them into their drop panel. In this project, we chose the forest theme and the icons are forest animals that can be dragged and placed in the tree house and the pond. By scrolling the characters section, you can select the desired character and place each of them in each of the defined sections of the panel. Each responsive icon/character has different audio that after dragging and dropping them on the panel, by clicking on the play button, their song will be played and they will start moving based on the animation designed for each.
